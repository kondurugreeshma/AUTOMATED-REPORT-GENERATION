 AUTOMATED REPORT GENERATION is a script that automates reading data from files (e.g., CSV, JSON), analyzing it, and generating formatted PDF reports using Pandas for data handling and FPDF/ReportLab for PDF creation.
**Features**
 Reads and processes data files (e.g., CSV, Excel).
 Analyzes data with key metrics and trends.
 Generates dynamic, formatted PDF reports with tables, charts, and summaries.
**Workflow**
1.**Input**: Reads and preprocesses raw data.
2.**Analysis**: Performs statistical calculations and cleans data.
3. **Report Generation**: Creates PDFs with titles, summaries, tables, and visuals.
4. **Output**: Saves or shares the PDF
